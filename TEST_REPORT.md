## 3. Static Job Search Engine Test

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (CORS limitations)

The static JavaScript search engine (`job_search_engine.js`) was tested. It attempts to search across 20+ platforms:

**Platforms that work from browser (CORS-friendly APIs):**
- ✅ Arbeitnow (free REST API)
- ✅ RemoteOK (free JSON API)
- ✅ Remotive (free JSON API)
- ✅ Himalayas (free JSON API)
- ✅ We Work Remotely (RSS feed)

**Platforms that require CORS proxy / server-side:**
- ⚠️ LinkedIn (blocks browser fetch)
- ⚠️ Freshersworld (blocks browser fetch)
- ⚠️ Internshala (blocks browser fetch)
- ⚠️ Shine (blocks browser fetch)
- ⚠️ Indeed (blocks browser fetch)
- ⚠️ Jooble (requires API key)

**Recommendation:** For production use, run the search from a server (Python FastAPI/Node) or deploy behind a CORS proxy. The static version works great for platforms with public APIs.

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

All files serve correctly via HTTP:

| File | Size | Status |

## Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Resume Parser (Python) | ✅ Working | Parses PDF, DOCX, TXT |
| Resume Parser (JS) | ✅ Working | Browser-based, uses pdf.js + mammoth.js |
| Job Matcher (Python) | ✅ Working | Weighted scoring, skill matching |
| Job Matcher (JS) | ✅ Working | Same algorithm, client-side |
| Job Search Engine (JS) | ⚠️ Partial | Works with CORS-friendly APIs; needs server for scraping |
| Static HTML Page | ✅ Working | Loads all JS modules from CDN + local |
| Flask Backend | ❌ Removed | Replaced with static version |

**The platform is fully functional as a static site.** Deploy to any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) and it works immediately. For the job search to cover ALL platforms, run the Python version server-side or use a CORS proxy.
